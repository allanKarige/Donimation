# Donimation
This is a 2D projection of a 3D donut(a torus to be more precise) rotated along two axes.The idea was by andy sloan and his code was written in C programming language.I took it as a fun project during this time in which i am learning python.The code is an adaptation from https://github.com/Oyoshi/super-duper-ascii-based-spinning-donut who did the same but more complex since he managed to add colours to the donut.This code is but a simpler version of his.https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html -This is a link to andy sloans blog post where he gives a detailed explanation of the program
